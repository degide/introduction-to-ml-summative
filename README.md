# Egg Yield Rate Prediction Project

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for predicting monthly egg yield rates among smallholder poultry farmers in Rwanda. The analysis uses original microdata from the Rwanda Agricultural Household Survey (AHS) 2024 and aims to provide actionable insights for agricultural extension services.

## Mission Statement

My mission is to leverage technology-driven and evidence-based solutions to enhance agricultural productivity, improve farm efficiency, empower smallholder farmers, and strengthen national food systems through scalable and measurable interventions.

## Files Included

- `EggYieldRate_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `ddi-documentation-english-123.pdf`: Data documentation for the AHS 2024 dataset.
- `Microdata.zip`: A zip file containing the dataset. An original copy is obtained upon proper authorization from the NIST microdata website.

## Requirements

- `Python 3.8+`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies** using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook EggYieldRate_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. **Run all cells** to reproduce the results and visualizations.

## Setup and Usage

- Use the notebook to explore the code, modify experiments, or apply the workflow to new data.
- Refer to the data documentation (`ddi-documentation-english-123.pdf`) for variable definitions and survey context.
- The microdata dataset is conveniently included in the repository under the `Microdata.zip` file
